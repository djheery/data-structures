# Binary Tree Data Structures

This folder consists of the implementation for the following Binary Tree Data Structures

- Binary Tree (Not Binary Search - Basically a rubbish tree) 
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Red Black Tree 

Where apporpriate I have added README files to the subfolders of this directory to explain the data structures a little more. 

## Order I would look through this section 

Below Is the order I would go through this folder: 

1. Binary Tree
2. Binary Search Tree
3. AVL Tree 
4. Red Black Tree (Currently I would not really look at this) 

## Note of Red-Black Tree

The Red-Black tree implemention and notes are not very good as I did not stick to a specific implementation style for the tree. 
This is due to picking up "Introduction to Algorithms" (Cormen, T. et al) half way through the implementation of this structure which uses an iterative method to implement it's operations, whereas I had already used a recursive method to implement the operations for insertion and search. 

Try as I might, I could not get a working recursive implemention of RBT delete so I have had to include alternative rotatation methods to help with the deletion method. 

It is my intention to go back and edit the red-black tree and make a recursive delete; however, I was losing motivation to complete this project due to how long I was spending on RBT so I have moved on to get some confidence back and will circle back around to it at a later date. 

I would reccommend creating a fresh Red-Black tree for your own purpose and writing your own notes - whilst I intend to get back to it and update it
