# What this Repositry Is 

This repositry is purely my attempt to get to grips with data structures and how they work in granular detail

To start with this project will consist of purely my attempts to create data structures in the C programming language. 

As of the start of this project I do not know C at all thus will include a small section which introduces the basic constructs of C. 
Then I will learn more about C by implementing the known data structures within the language.  

**The data structures may contain errors. This is not meant to be a comprehensive handling of all edge cases for a data structure. More an experimentation with them to get to grips with how they are built and thus understand more deeply how they work**

## Included Data Structure Types 

Each folder will contain a core data structure and then the sub folders will contain their associated sub-data types. For example, Arrays will contain Stacks, Queues, etc.

The list is comprised of items from the wikipedia data structures list

- Arrays 
- Binary Trees 
- Lists 
- Graphs 
- Hash Based Structures 
- Heaps
